We report for the first time the successful transduction of human HO-1 gene into rat lung microvessel endothelium using replication-defective retroviral vector. Cells transduced with human HO-1 gene exhibited a 2.1-fold increase in HO-1 protein level, which was associated with a 2.3-fold elevation in enzyme activity compared with that in nontransduced cells. The cGMP content in transduced endothelial cells was increased by 2.9-fold relative to that in nontransduced cells. Moreover, human HO-1 gene-transduced endothelial cells acquired substantial resistance to toxicity produced by exposure to heme and H2O2 compared with that in nontransduced cells. The protective effect of enhancement of HO-1 activity against heme and H2O2 was reversed by pretreatment with stannic mesoporphyrin, a competitive inhibitor of HO. These data demonstrate that the induction of HO-1 in response to injurious stimuli represents an important mechanism for moderating the severity of cell damage.

Alzheimer's disease does not appear to result from a single alteration, but in some cases of inherited AD a specific genetic defect can precipitate the disease. In this article, metabolic compromise, altered metabolism of the beta-amyloid precursor protein (betaAPP), and an excitotoxic form of neuronal injury are considered central to the pathogenesis AD. The hypothesis is forwarded that destabilization of neuronal Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis underlies neuronal degeneration and that multiple age-associated and/or genetic alterations contribute to the loss of Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis. Recent studies showed that the secreted forms of betaAPP (APP(s)s) stabilize intracellular free calcium levels ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>](i)) and protect neurons against excitotoxic insults. In contrast, Abeta which arises from alternative processing of betaAPP forms free radical peptides and aggregates that destabilize [Ca<sup>2+</sup>](i) and make neurons vulnerable to metabolic insults. Increased expression (eg, Down's syndrome) or altered processing leg, betaAPP mutations) of betaAPP may increase the Abeta/APP(s) ratio. The death of neurons in AD most likely has an excitotoxic component because: the vulnerable neurons possess high levels of glutamate receptors; experimentally induced excitotoxicity shows several features similar to those of neurofibrillary tangles; and Abeta can destabilize [Ca<sup>2+</sup>](i) homeostasis and render neurons vulnerable to neurofibrillary degeneration. Selective vulnerability may result from cell type-specific differences in expression of proteins involved in regulating [Ca<sup>2+</sup>](i). In addition, many intercellular signals are involved in determining whether a neuron is able to maintain [Ca<sup>2+</sup>](i) within a range of concentrations conducive to cell survival and adaptive plasticity. In this regard, it was recently shown that several growth factors can stabilize [Ca<sup>2+</sup>](i) and protect neurons against excitotoxic injury and Abeta toxicity.

Alzheimer's disease does not appear to result from a single alteration, but in some cases of inherited AD a specific genetic defect can precipitate the disease. In this article, metabolic compromise, altered metabolism of the beta-amyloid precursor protein (betaAPP), and an excitotoxic form of neuronal injury are considered central to the pathogenesis AD. The hypothesis is forwarded that destabilization of neuronal Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis underlies neuronal degeneration and that multiple age-associated and/or genetic alterations contribute to the loss of Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis. Recent studies showed that the secreted forms of betaAPP (APP(s)s) stabilize intracellular free calcium levels ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>](i)) and protect neurons against excitotoxic insults. In contrast, Abeta which arises from alternative processing of betaAPP forms free radical peptides and aggregates that destabilize [Ca<sup>2+</sup>](i) and make neurons vulnerable to metabolic insults. Increased expression (eg, Down's syndrome) or altered processing leg, betaAPP mutations) of betaAPP may increase the Abeta/APP(s) ratio. The death of neurons in AD most likely has an excitotoxic component because: the vulnerable neurons possess high levels of glutamate receptors; experimentally induced excitotoxicity shows several features similar to those of neurofibrillary tangles; and Abeta can destabilize [Ca<sup>2+</sup>](i) homeostasis and render neurons vulnerable to neurofibrillary degeneration.

Peripheral nerves in diabetes mellitus are more prone to injury than those of nondiabetics. We sought to determine whether reperfusion-induced, oxygen-derived free radical injury occurs in peripheral nerves subjected to acute compression in normal and chronically diabetic rats. Female Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 250 to 275 g (N = 347) were divided into two groups: normal and streptozocin-induced diabetics. A total of 187 normal and 160 diabetic nerves were analyzed. After 8 weeks of untreated hyperglycemia, the sciatic nerves of normal and diabetes mellitus rats were subjected to one of three operations: a sham operation, 24-hour compression alone, and 24-hour compression followed by 1-hour reperfusion (CR). Nerve compression was established by banding the right sciatic nerve with a Silastic tubing, 1 cm long and 0.62 mm internal diameter, which was secured with 6-0 nylon suture. In the CR group, after 24 hours of compression, the tubings were released for 1 hour to permit reperfusion. Nerve tissue within the zone of compression underwent biopsy examination and was frozen for subsequent analysis. Blood flow to the nerve was quantified by injecting fluorescein (10 mg/kg intravenously) 10 minutes before harvest and measuring tissue levels fluorometrically. Compression with the Silastic tubing significantly reduced neural blood flow by 75%. Blood flow improved but failed to return to baseline levels after tubing release in diabetes mellitus nerves while perfusion returned to baseline in non-diabetes mellitus nerves. Nerve homogenate was assayed for malonyldialdehyde, an indicator of lipoperoxidation, as well as enzymes of cellular defense and glucose metabolism. Antioxidants, deferoxamine and lazaroid U74389F, were given at various time intervals in an attempt to reduce oxidative injury. Malonyldialdehyde levels rose significantly after reperfusion: a 310% increase from baseline in diabetes mellitus nerves (p < 0.01) and a 147% increase in non-diabetes mellitus nerves (p < 0.05). Enzymes of cellular defense and glucose metabolism increased activity during nerve compression (ischemia). While activities remained elevated or increased in non-diabetes mellitus nerves after reperfusion, enzyme activities in diabetes mellitus nerves tended to decline, suggesting an inability of diabetes mellitus nerves to tolerate reperfusion-induced metabolic stress. Both deferoxamine and lazaroid U74389F significantly reduced malonyldialdehyde levels from those of untreated controls in reperfused diabetes mellitus nerves. We conclude that incomplete ischemia was created in this experimental model and peripheral nerves were susceptible to free radical damage as reflected by increased lipid peroxidation and decreased antioxidant defenses.

First published October 22, 2010; doi: 10.1152/ajpheart.00679.2010.-Hypertension alters cerebrovascular regulation and increases the brain's susceptibility to stroke and dementia. We investigated the temporal relationships between the arterial pressure (AP) elevation induced by ""slow pressor"" angiotensin II (ANG II) infusion, which recapitulates key features of human hypertension, and the resulting cerebrovascular dysfunction. Minipumps delivering saline or ANG II for 14 days were implanted subcutaneously in C57BL/6 mice (n = 5/group). Cerebral blood flow was assessed by laser-Doppler flowmetry in anesthetized mice equipped with a cranial window. With ANG II (600 ng.kg(-1).min(-1)), AP started to rise after 9 days (P < 0.05 vs. saline), remained elevated at 11-17 days, and returned to baseline at 21 days (P > 0.05). ANG II attenuated the cerebral blood flow increase induced by neural activity (whisker stimulation) or endothelium-dependent vasodilators, an effect observed before the AP elevation (7 days), as well as after the hypertension subsided (21 days).

First published October 22, 2010; doi: 10.1152/ajpheart.00679.2010.-Hypertension alters cerebrovascular regulation and increases the brain's susceptibility to stroke and dementia. We investigated the temporal relationships between the arterial pressure (AP) elevation induced by ""slow pressor"" angiotensin II (ANG II) infusion, which recapitulates key features of human hypertension, and the resulting cerebrovascular dysfunction. Minipumps delivering saline or ANG II for 14 days were implanted subcutaneously in C57BL/6 mice (n = 5/group). Cerebral blood flow was assessed by laser-Doppler flowmetry in anesthetized mice equipped with a cranial window. With ANG II (600 ng.kg(-1).min(-1)), AP started to rise after 9 days (P < 0.05 vs. saline), remained elevated at 11-17 days, and returned to baseline at 21 days (P > 0.05). ANG II attenuated the cerebral blood flow increase induced by neural activity (whisker stimulation) or endothelium-dependent vasodilators, an effect observed before the AP elevation (7 days), as well as after the hypertension subsided (21 days). Nonpressor doses of ANG II (200 ng.kg(-1).min(-1)) induced cerebrovascular dysfunction and oxidative stress without elevating AP (P < 0.05 vs. saline), whereas phenylephrine elevated AP without inducing cerebrovascular effects.

Presently, activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway has been implicated as a major contributor to neuronal survival after an ischemic insult. In the present study, we investigated whether NRG-1 modulates the activation of Akt and its downstream targets Bad and Bcl-2 expression after transient focal cerebral ischemia by intralummal blockade of the middle cerebral artery.

Methods: Seven-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to left common carotid artery ligation followed by a 90-min exposure of 8% oxygen. The rats were administered morphine (0.1, 0.3 or 1 mg/kg/h) or saline continuously for 72 h using osmotic minipumps.

Methods: After IRB approval, 39 Sprague-Dawley rats were included in the study. Twelve anesthetized animals were preconditioned by right middle cerebral artery (rMCA) occlusion for 2 min using the intraluminar suture technique3. The occlusion was released, and the animals were awakened without neurologic deficit. Twenty-four hours later, the rats were anesthetized with an intravenous infusion of fentanyl/midazolam and ventilated with 0.3 FiO2. The PaCO2 was controlled at 40+-3 mmHg and the temperature at 38degreeC. The mean arterial blood pressure was reduced by bleeding to 55 mmHg. Then, the rMCA was occluded for 90 min. The rats were randomly sacrificed at 5 or 240 min of reperfusion. In the control group, the animals (n=12) were subjected to 90 min rMCA occlusion followed by 5 or 240 min of reperfusion. Ten rats were sham-operated (n=5 for each group) and 5 rats were sham-preconditioned. The brain tissue reducing power, which is derived from the LMWA, was evaluated by cyclic voltammetry (CV)4.

Student's t-test was used for between-groups comparisons at specific time points; p<0.05 was considered significant. Results: In CV tracings of brain, two anodic waves were identified at 370 and 750 mV. The first consisted of ascorbate and urate and the second included imidazole-containing molecules. In the control group, at 5 min of reperfusion, the first current of the infarcted brain hemisphere decreased from 0.209+-0.062 (basal) to 0.149+-0.021(p<0.05), indicating a fall in LMWA concentration. By contrast, in the preconditioned rats the LMWA levels increased 2-fold at 5 min of reperfusion (from 0.211+-0.037 to 0.531+-0.114, p<0.001). At 4 hr of reperfusion, the antioxidants increased 14 and 18% above basal values in the control and preconditioned group respectively. Similar changes were observed in the second anodic current. No difference in LMWA levels was observed between the sham preconditioned and control groups. Discussion: The reduction in LMWA after brain ischemia in the control group suggests their consumption, probably due to interaction with locally produced ROS. The higher concentration of LMWA in preconditioned rats suggests that ischemic preconditioning improves the capacity of the brain to produce (or recruit) endogenous antioxidants in response to a second ischemic insult.","Aim: Reactive oxygen species (ROS) released in the brain during sublethal ischemia induce defense mechanisms against oxidative stress1, thereby enhancing tolerance to a subsequent, otherwise lethal insult.

Acidosis activates some kind of endonuclease, which may lead to apoptosis1. Acidosis also enhances free radical production in cerebral ischemia2. Accordingly, acidosis may deteriorate cerebral ischemic injury by increasing apoptotic cell death through free redical production. In this study, we evaluated which type of cell death (necrosis or apoptosis) acidosis enhanced after a hypoxic insult in neuronal cells. Secondly, we examined the effect of antioxidants on the cell death. As neuronal cells, we utilized PC 12 cells, which are derived from rat pheochromocytoma. Materials and Methods: No institutional Review Board approval was required, since this study involved cell cultures and did not involve animal subjects. PC 12 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum and 5% horse serum. The cells were moved to HEPES-buffered medium, the pH of which was arranged at 7.4, 6.8, 6.2, 5.6 or 5.0. A hypoxic insult was induced by filling the chamber in N 2 . Oxygen concentration was strictly maintained between 1 and 2 % using an oxygen electrode. Twenty-four hours after incubation, the cells were harvested.

METHODS: Rats were randomly assigned to simvastatin, vehicle, or sham-surgery (sham) groups (n = 6 per group). Simvastatin (10 mg/kg) or vehicle was administered subcutaneously once daily for 7 days before aortic balloon occlusion, and once at 24 hours after reperfusion. Spinal cord ischemia was induced by balloon inflation of a 2F Fogarty catheter in the thoracic aorta, and the proximal mean arterial blood pressure was maintained at 40 mm Hg for 12 minutes. The sham group received the same operation without inflation of the balloon. Ischemic injury was assessed by hindlimb motor function using the Motor Deficit Index score at 6 to 48 hours after ischemic reperfusion, and histological assessment of the spinal cord was performed 48 hours after reperfusion.

Results: Mn-TM-2-PyP, given 60 min pre-MCAO, provided a dose-dependent reduction in total infarct size (vehicle: 188 +- 81 mm3; Mn-TM-2-PyP 150 ng: 61 +- 48 mm3; Mn-TM-2-PyP 300 ng: 47 +- 51 mm3).

At 4 hrs post-ischemia, mitochondrial aconitase activity was preserved and formation of 8-hydroxyguanine was markedly reduced by Mn-TM-2-PyP. Conclusions: Administration of the metalloporphyrin catalytic antioxidant Mn-TM-2-PyP had marked neuroprotective effects against focal ischemic insults when given as late as 6 hours post-ischemia.

The efficacy of delayed administration of the anti-oxidant is consistent with recent evidence that production of reactive oxygen species is sustained for substantial intervals after ischemia.","Background: Superoxide (O2-) and other reactive O2 species are known to contribute to ischemic brain injury.1 This study examined if a porphyrin ring based catalytic anti-oxidant (Mn-TM-2-PyP)2 reduces oxidative stress and improves outcome from transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in rats. Methods: With approval by the local animal care and use committee, normothermic Wistar rats were subjected to 90 min of MCAO. Mn-TM-2-PyP (or vehicle) was given intracerebroventricularly 60 min pre-ischemia or at 5 min, 90 min, or 6 hrs after reperfusion. After 7 days recovery, neurologic and histologic outcome was determined. In separate animals, neurochemical markers of brain oxidative stress such as mitochondrial aconitase activity and formation of 8-hydroxyguanine were measured at 4 hrs post-ischemia. Results: Mn-TM-2-PyP, given 60 min pre-MCAO, provided a dose-dependent reduction in total infarct size (vehicle: 188 +- 81 mm3; Mn-TM-2-PyP 150 ng: 61 +- 48 mm3; Mn-TM-2-PyP 300 ng: 47 +- 51 mm3). When 300 ng Mn-TM-2-PyP was given 5 min or 90 min after reperfusion from MCAO, infarct size was also markedly reduced (vehicle: 143 +- 75 mm3; 5 min: 41 +- 58 mm3; 90 min: 31 +- 22 mm3).

Thus, the effects of post-ischemic selective brain cooling on extracellular release of ascorbate and glutamate during forebrain ischemia-reperfusion in rat hippocampus was continuously measured in vivo using a microdialysis biosensor system. METHODS: Male Wistar rats (n=20) were anesthetized with halothane under mechanical ventilation. Mean arterial pressure (MAP), cortical CBF measured by laser-Doppler flowmeter, and rectal and cortical temperature were continuously recorded. Two probes of a microdialysis biosensor electrode were inserted stereotaxically in the bilateral hippocampus. One probe was perfused with Ringer's solution and the oxidation signal of dialyzed ascorbate was recorded 2). A second probe was electropolymerised and perfused with Ringer's solution containing glutamate oxidase for glutamate measurement. Forebrain ischemia-reperfusion was performed by bilateral carotid artery occlusion with hemorrhagic hypotension (MAP=30mmHg) for 10 min followed by reperfusion for 60 min. Immediately after reperfusion, brain cortical temperature was controlled 36degreeC (Group N) or 32degreeC (Group H) while rectal temperature was held at normothermia (37-38degreeC). Repeated-measures of ANOVA followed by Scheffe's test and unpaired t-test were used for statistical analyses. RESULTS: During ischemia, extracellular release of glutamate increased markedly from 40 to 160muM immediately after reperfusion, and then decreased rapidly. In Group N, however, it remained significantly higher for 15 - 25 min after reperfusion compared to that in Group H. Release of ascorbate (60 muM at control) increased slightly during ischemia, but increased significantly to maximums of 166muM in Group N and 212 muM in Group H after reperfusion. In Group H, it was significantly higher for 5 - 40 min after reperfusion compared to that in Group N. CONCLUSION: The marked increase of extracellular ascorbate during reperfusion after ischemia was associated with the rapid decrease of extracellular glutamate in both groups. Post-ischemic brain cooling caused a significant increase in ascorbate release and glutamate re-uptake during reperfusion along with significantly higher MAP and cortical CBF. These results suggest that a marked extracellular release of ascorbate by post-ischemic hypothermia consistents with the reported ascorbate-mediated protection from glutamate cytotoxicity.","INTRODUCTION: Ascorbate, a major antioxidant in the brain, is highly concentrated in neuropils. In previous experiments 1), its extracellular release is closely related to that of glutamate during reperfusion after forebrain ischemia in rats. Although the protective effects of intra-ischemic hypothermia are known, the efficacy of post-ischemic hypothermia remains controversial.

RESULTS: Isoflurane increased regional cerebral cortical blood flow by 9 +/- 3, 46 +/- 21, and 101 +/- 26% (SD) at 1.2, 1.8, and 2.4 vol%, respectively.

Calpain caseinolytic activity was found to increase in both hemispheres for at least 20 hr. Hypoxic exposure per se increased the activity of calpains, more pronounced in a membrane-associated fraction, probably through interaction with cellular components, whereas HI introduced a loss of activity, most likely through consumption and loss of proteases. Consecutive tissue sections were stained with antibodies against calpastatin, alpha-fodrin, the 150-kDa breakdown product of alpha-fodrin (FBDP, marker of calpain proteolysis) or microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP-2, marker of dendrosomatic neuronal injury). Areas with brain injury displayed a distinct loss of MAP-2, which clearly delineated the infarct. FBDP accumulated in injured and borderline regions ipsilaterally, and a less conspicuous, transient increase in FBDP also occurred in the contralateral hemisphere, especially in the white matter. The cytosolic fraction (CF) and the membrane and microsomal fraction (MMF) of cortical tissue were subjected to Western blotting and stained with antibodies against calpain, calpastatin and the 150-kDa breakdown product of alpha-fodrin (FBDP). Calpain immunoreactivity decreased bilaterally in the CF during the insult (62-68% of controls) and remained significantly lower during early recovery, whereas the MMF showed no significant changes. This translocation of calpains coincided with the appearance of FBDP in the ipsilateral, HI hemisphere, displaying a significantly higher level of FBDP from immediately after the insult until at least 1 day of recovery (204-292% of controls). No significant changes in FBDP were found in the contralateral, undamaged hemisphere, despite translocation of calpains in both hemispheres, a prerequisite for calpain activation. This discrepancy may be related to changes in the endogenous inhibitor, calpastatin. Calpastatin protein was found to decrease during and shortly after HI in the ipsilateral, but not the contralateral, hemisphere. The inhibitory activity of calpastatin also tended to decrease after HI, indicating that a reduction of calpastatin may be necessary for extensive calpain activation to occur. The mRNA of m-calpain increased in the HI hemisphere 48 hr after the insult (167%, p < 0.001), a time point when the protein was also increased. In summary, our findings indicate that calpains are activated during HI and in the early phase of reperfusion after HI, preceding neuronal death.","Neonatal rats were subjected to transient cerebral hypoxic-ischemia (HI, unilateral occlusion of the common carotid artery + 7.70% O<sub>2</sub> for 100 min) and allowed to recover for up to 14 days.

In the present study, we investigated the effect of the PPAR-gamma agonist rosiglitazone on changes in venous permeability during chronic hypertension induced by nitric oxide synthase inhibition. Female Sprague-Dawley rats were either treated with N-G-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME; 0.5 g/1 in drinking water) for 5 wk (HTN; n = 8), L-NAME for 5 wk plus the PPAR-gamma agonist rosiglitazone (20 mg/kg in food) for the last 3 wk (HTN + Rosi; n = 5), L-NAME for 5 wk plus the superoxide dismutase mimetic Tempol ( 1 mmol/1 in drinking water) for the last 3 wk (HTN + Tempol; n = 8), or were untreated controls (n = 9). Fluid filtration (J(v)/S) and hydraulic conductivity (L-p) of cerebral veins were compared in vitro between groups after a step increase in pressure from 10 to 25 mmHg to mimic the change in hydrostatic pressure during acute hypertension. Hypertension increased J(v)/S by 2.2-fold and L-p by 3.2-fold. Rosiglitazone treatment after 2 wk of hypertension completely reversed the increased J(v)/S and L-p that occurred during hypertension, whereas Tempol had no effect. These results demonstrate that rosiglitazone was effective at reversing changes in venous permeability that occurred during chronic hypertension, an effect that does not appear to be related to its antioxidant properties. Our findings suggest that PPAR-gamma may be a key regulator of blood-brain barrier permeability and a potential therapeutic target during hypertension.","Roberts TJ, Chapman AC, Cipolla MJ.

In group F, it was also shown that MDA level elevation had been prevented, and group F has increased the antioxidant enzyme activities than the other experimental groups C, D, E (p < 0.05). Conclusions. We concluded that the use of combined hypothermia and HBO treatment might have potential benefits in spinal cord tissue on secondary damage. (C) 2010 IMSS.

The effects of dietary flax seed on a high cholesterol diet induced atherosclerosis, lipid profile and OFR-producing activity of PMNLs (PMNL-CL) were investigated in rabbits. The rabbits were divided into 4 groups: group I, control; group II, flax seed diet (7.5 g/kg daily, orally); group III, 1% cholesterol diet; and group IV, same as group III but received flax seed (7.5 g/kg daily, orally). Blood samples were collected before and after 4 and 8 weeks on their respective diets for biochemical measurements and aortae were removed at the end of 8 weeks for estimation of atherosclerotic changes. The high cholesterol diet increased the serum level of total cholesterol (TC) and PMNL-CL without altering the levels of serum triglycerides (TG).

First published January 13, 2012; doi:10.1152/ajpheart.00340.2011.-Recent studies have indicated that inhibitors of the synthesis of 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (20-HETE) may have direct neuroprotective actions since they reduce infarct volume after ischemia reperfusion in the brain without altering blood flow. To explore this possibility, the present study used organotypic hippocampal slice cultures subjected to oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) and reoxygenation to examine whether 20-HETE is released by organotypic hippocampal slices after OGD and whether it contributes to neuronal death through the generation of ROS and activation of caspase-3.

First published January 13, 2012; doi:10.1152/ajpheart.00340.2011.-Recent studies have indicated that inhibitors of the synthesis of 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (20-HETE) may have direct neuroprotective actions since they reduce infarct volume after ischemia reperfusion in the brain without altering blood flow. To explore this possibility, the present study used organotypic hippocampal slice cultures subjected to oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) and reoxygenation to examine whether 20-HETE is released by organotypic hippocampal slices after OGD and whether it contributes to neuronal death through the generation of ROS and activation of caspase-3. The production of 20-HETE increased twofold after OGD and reoxygenation.

However, while a growing number of recent studies have described this finding, no study to date has addressed the mechanism by which this potentiation occurs. This study tested the hypothesis that potentiated EDHF-mediated dilations are due to altered endothelial Ca2+ handling following I/R. Methods: Rat middle cerebral arteries (MCAs) were isolated following 2 hours MCA occlusion and 24 hours reperfusion (or sham surgery). This model has been previously demonstrated to produce potentiated EDHF-mediated dilations. MCAs were studied in a pressurized/perfused vessel chamber equipped for the simultaneous measurement of endothelial Ca2+ (with fura-2) and artery diameter. Measures were made following luminal administration of UTP (P2Y2 purinoceptor agonist), 2MeS-ATP (P2Y1 purinoceptor agonist), and Br-A23187 (receptor-independent Ca2+ ionophore) for sham and I/R MCAs. Responses to UTP and Br-A23187 were performed in the presence of L-NAME/indomethacin (nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase inhibitors, respectively) in order to focus on the EDHF component of the dilation. Since dilations to 2MeS-ATP typically do not involve an EDHF component, these responses were evaluated without L-NAME/indomethacin so that NO-mediated dilations could be measured. 2MeS-ATP responses were evaluated for the purpose of determining if altered endothelial Ca2+ regulation occurred in more than one receptor type. Results: Resting endothelial Ca2+ did not differ between sham and I/R groups. However, endothelial Ca2+ increased significantly more for a given agonist concentration following I/R for each of the agonists studied. Furthermore, vasodilatation responses were potentiated for both UTP and 2MeS-ATP. Evaluation of artery diameter as a function of endothelial Ca2+ demonstrated no differences between sham and I/R groups. Thus, endothelial Ca2+ sensitivity of the EDHF-dependent mechanism did not appear to contribute to the potentiated dilations. Conclusions: These data demonstrate that endothelial Ca2+ regulation is altered following I/R such that augmented endothelial Ca2+ responses result.

Methods: Adult Wistar rats were treated per gavage, during 18 days, with 2.5, 10 or 90 mu g/kg/d astaxanthin dissolved in ethanol (3 g/kg) and CSD was recorded on the cortical surface I to 3 days thereafter. Four groups, treated respectively with ethanol, distilled water and soybean oil with- and without astaxanthin were also studied for comparison with the ethanol + astaxanthin groups. Results: Ethanol-treated rats displayed higher CSD-velocities (mean values, in min/min, per hour of recording ranging from 4.08 +/- 0.09 to 4.12 +/- 0.16), compared to the distilled water-group (from 3.19 +/- 0.13 to 3.27 +/- 0.06). Addition of astaxanthin to ethanol lead to lower CSD-velocities in a dose-dependent manner, ranging from 3.68 +/- 0.09 to 3.97 +/- 0.22 for the 2.5 mu g/kg/d-dose, from 3.29 +/- 0.09 to 3.32 +/- 0.07 for the 10 mu g/kg/d-dose, and from 2.89 +/- 0.13 to 2.92 +/- 0.11 for the 90 mu g/kg/d-dose. The velocities of the soybean oil groups (with and without astaxanthin) were not statistically different from the 10 mu g/kg/d astaxanthin + ethanol and distilled water groups. Conclusion: The results demonstrate the antagonistic effect of astaxanthin against the ethanol-induced facilitation of CSD propagation. Probably carotenoid antioxidant properties are involved in such effects.","Background: The consumption of alcoholic drinks is a frequent drug-abuse situation, which is associated to a wide variety of pathological disturbances affecting several organs, including the brain. We have previously shown in the developing rat brain that ethanol intake facilitates the propagation of cortical spreading depression (CSD), an excitability-related neural phenomenon present in several animal species.

Methods: Mature mixed cerebrocortical neuronal-glial cell cultures, treated or not with increasing concentrations of sevoflurane, were exposed to 90 min combined oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) in an anaerobic chamber followed by reoxygenation. Cell death was quantified by lactate dehydrogenase release into the media and cell viability by reduction of 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium by mitochondrial succinate dehydrogenase. Extracellular concentrations of glutamate and glutamate uptake were assessed at the end of the ischemic injury by high-performance liquid chromatography and incorporation of L-[H-3]glutamate into cells, respectively.

Dexmedetomidine, a highly selective alpha2-adrenoreceptor agonist, decreases central sympathetic activity and reduces the anesthetic requirement of halothane. Preliminary studies show that dexmedetomidine improves the outcome from ischemic injury and, therefore, may have potential therapeutic value. Methods: The authors studied 14 rabbits that underwent a 2-h occlusion of the left internal carotid, anterior cerebral, and middle cerebral arteries, followed by 4 h of reperfusion. Ten minutes after occlusion, the animals were treated with either normal saline (n = 7) or dexmedetomidine (n = 7) using a computer-controlled infusion rate calculated to maintain a steady state plasma concentration. Halothane concentration was reduced by 50% for dexmedetomidine-treated animals to maintain a comparable level of anesthesia. Somatosensory evoked potentials were used to confirm adequate ischemia, and injury was assessed by histopathology. Results: There were significant differences in the area of ischemic neuronal damage between the groups in the cortex (halothane alone, 38.2 +/- 6.0% SEM vs. halothane plus dexmedetomidine, 20.0 +/- 2.7% SEM, P = 0.018), but not in the striatum (halothane alone, 68.7 +/- 12.6% SEM vs. halothane plus dexmedetomidine, 43.5 +/- 15.9% SEM, P = 0.24), nor in physiologic parameters. Dexmedetomidine plasma levels obtained every 90 min showed a mean of 4.0 +/- 0.15 ng/ml. Conclusions: Results from this study indicate that postischemic administration of dexmedetomidine, in a dose that reduces the anesthetic requirements by 50%, has a neuroprotective effect in this model of focal cerebral ischemia.","Background.

Methods: Seven-day-old rats were subjected to unilateral carotid artery occlusion and hypoxia followed by intraperitoneal treatment with PFT-mu, an inhibitor of p53 mitochondrial association or PFT-alpha an inhibitor of p53 transcriptional activity. Cerebral damage, sensorimotor and cognitive function, apoptotic pathways (cytosolic cytochrome c, Smac/DIABLO, active caspase 3), and oxidative stress (lipid peroxidation and PARP-1 cleavage) were investigated. Results: PFT-mu treatment completely prevented the HI-induced increase in mitochondrial p53 association at 3 hours and reduced neuronal damage at 48 hours post-HI. PFT-mu had long-term (6-10 weeks post-HI) beneficial effects as sensorimotor and cognitive outcome improved and infarct size was reduced by ~79%. Neuroprotection by PFT-mu treatment was associated with strong inhibition of apoptotic pathways and reduced oxidative stress. Unexpectedly, PFT-mu also inhibited HI-induced upregulation of p53 target genes. However, the neuroprotective effect of inhibiting only p53 transcriptional activity by PFT-alpha was significantly smaller and did not involve reduced oxidative stress. Interpretation: We are the first to show that prevention of mitochondrial p53 association by PFT-mu strongly improves functional outcome and decreases lesion size after neonatal HI. PFT-mu not only inhibits mitochondrial release of cytochrome c, but also inhibits oxidative stress. We propose that as a consequence nuclear accumulation of p53 and transcription of proapoptotic target genes are prevented.

Methods: Seven-day-old rats were subjected to unilateral carotid artery occlusion and hypoxia followed by intraperitoneal treatment with PFT-mu, an inhibitor of p53 mitochondrial association or PFT-alpha an inhibitor of p53 transcriptional activity. Cerebral damage, sensorimotor and cognitive function, apoptotic pathways (cytosolic cytochrome c, Smac/DIABLO, active caspase 3), and oxidative stress (lipid peroxidation and PARP-1 cleavage) were investigated. Results: PFT-mu treatment completely prevented the HI-induced increase in mitochondrial p53 association at 3 hours and reduced neuronal damage at 48 hours post-HI. PFT-mu had long-term (6-10 weeks post-HI) beneficial effects as sensorimotor and cognitive outcome improved and infarct size was reduced by similar to 79%. Neuroprotection by PFT-mu treatment was associated with strong inhibition of apoptotic pathways and reduced oxidative stress. Unexpectedly, PFT-mu also inhibited HI-induced upregulation of p53 target genes. However, the neuroprotective effect of inhibiting only p53 transcriptional activity by PFT-alpha was significantly smaller and did not involve reduced oxidative stress.

Furthermore, estrogen seems to specifically protect cortical and hippocampal neurons from iscbemic injury. Here our data evaluating the neuroprotective effects of estrogens, the selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs), and estrogen receptor alpha- and beta-selective ligands in animal models of ischemic injury are discussed. In rats and mice, the middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model was used as models representing cerebrovascular stroke, while in gerbils the two-vessel occlusion model, resenting acute heart attack, was used. Using focal ischemia in ovariectomized ERalphaKO, ERbetaKO, and wild-type mice, we clearly established that the ERalpha subtype is the critical ER-mediating neuroprotection in mouse focal ischemia. Because of the characteristic blood supply of the gerbil, the gerbil global ischemia model was used to evaluate the neuroprotective effects of estrogen, SERMs, and ERalpha- and ERbeta-selective compounds in the hippocampus.

Furthermore, estrogen seems to specifically protect cortical and hippocampal neurons from iscbemic injury.

In rats and mice, the middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model was used as models representing cerebrovascular stroke, while in gerbils the two-vessel occlusion model, resenting acute heart attack, was used.

Objective: In this study, we aimed to evaluate the relationship between the activities of antioxidant enzymes [superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPX), and catalase (CAT)] in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and severity of hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) in newborns. Methods: Thirty full-term asphyxiated infants (gestational age >37 weeks) and 11 full-term infants (none of whom showed any signs of asphyxia) were included in this study. Activities of SOD, GPX, and CAT in CSF were measured within the first 72 h of life in infants with HIE and controls. Results: Activity of SOD in CSF was significantly higher in infants with HIE compared with controls (p < 0.05). GPX and CAT activities were higher in infants with HIE than they were in controls; however, the differences were not statistically significant (p > 0.05). The activities of GPX and CAT were significantly increased in severe HIE as compared with mild HIE and controls (p < 0.05).

A significant constriction persisted for at least 60 min [maximum, -15+-6 % for large (gtoreq75 mum) and -26+-7% for small arterioles (< 75 mum) compared with baseline]. In E-100 group, the constriction of large and small arterioles was significantly attenuated (at 60 min, -8+-6% and -11+-8 % constriction), but smaller dose of edaravone did not produce any changes in cerebral vessel diameter compared with control group. Conclusion: Release of a 20-min aortic cross-clamp induced a sustained pial arteriolar constriction. This unclamping-induced vasoconstriction could be attenuated by IV infusion of edaravone. The attenuation of such vasoconstriction may be favorable in clinical setting.",0.999916036943745,2003,2003,1,"2003","2003",1,"A-851","Abstract-851",0.485,NA,NA,NA,"Anesthesiology Abstracts of Scientific Papers Annual Meeting","Anesthesiology Abstracts of Scientific Papers Annual Meeting",1,NA,NA,NA,"20499","8802"

Anesthesia was maintained with intravenous infusion of Fentanyl-Midazolam.The animals were under general anesthesia,mechanical ventilation,normocapnia, normotension and normotermia during the experiment. The right middle cerebral artery was occluded using the intraluminar suture technique [2] for 90 min. Then the occlusion was released allowing reperfusion. Animals (5 in each group)were randomly sacrificed at 0,5,30,60 or 240 min after reperfusion. Two rats were sham-operated. Brain LMWA were measured by cyclic voltammetry[3]. PGE2 was evaluated by radioimmunoassay. Values are expressed as mean ±SEM in μamp/mg protein and analyzed by ANOVA. p<0.05 was considered significant.Results:At termination of ischemia,the LMWA in the infarcted area decreased from basal level of 0.248±0.008 to 0.215±0.018(p<0.05). At reperfusion,a gradual increase of LMWA occurred up to 4h,reaching 0.332±0.016(p<0.01). There were no significant changes in the perifocal area and contralateral hemisphere. PGE2 increased 3-fold at 5 min of reperfusion and remained high in both hemispheres.Discussion:We suggest that the arachidonic acid,which accumulates during ischemia,is oxidized at initiation of reperfusion and increases the production of ROS. Excessive ROS during ischemia causes consumption of LMWA. The delayed increase of LMWA (4h)is due to recycling or recruitment, providing endogenous neuroprotective mechanism.",NA,2000,2000,1,"3A","3A",1,"U187-U187","U187-U187",1,"93","93",1,"AnesthesiologyAnesthesiology","AnesthesiologyAnesthesiologyAnesthesiology",0.933333333333333,NA,NA,NA,"15286","2595"

In the current study, we determined CBF during administration of isoflurane for 4 h in cynomolgus monkeys. In addition, we determined if nitric oxide (NO) contributes to cerebrovascular tone during isoflurane anesthesia by determining the CBF (microsphere) response to inhibition of NO synthase with N omega-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME). METHODS: CBF was measured in five monkeys anesthetized with isoflurane (1.0% end-tidal). After 4 h of isoflurane (1.0% = 1 MAC), the effects of intravenous L-NAME (60 mg/kg over 10 min) followed by intravenous L-arginine (600 mg/kg over 10 min) on CBF were measured at constant cerebral perfusion pressure and arterial carbon dioxide tension. RESULTS: CBF was unchanged over time (4 h) in cerebellum but increased by 50 +/- 18% in both forebrain and hindbrain (P < 0.05). CBF decreased by 41-48% (P < 0.05) 20 min after L-NAME in forebrain, cerebellum, and hindbrain, at which time brain NO synthase activity was less than 10% of baseline.

However, the signaling mechanisms associated with GPR30 in the vasculature remain unclear. We examined whether putative agonists of GPR30 exert vasorelaxant and/or antioxidant effects similar to those reported for estrogen. Using wire myography, we assessed the role of the endothelium in relaxation responses to the GPR30 agonists, G-1 and 5408-0877 (1 nM-10 muM), in U-46619-precontracted common carotid arteries from Sprague-Dawley rats. Furthermore, using lucigenin (5 muM)-enhanced chemiluminescence, we tested the effect of G-1 (10 muM) on superoxide levels. Specific immunofluorescence was also used to confirm GPR30 expression in the arterial wall. We found that G-1 and 5408-0877 induced a concentration-dependent relaxation in carotid arteries from both male and female rats. Interestingly, G-1- and 5408-0877-induced relaxation was abolished by endothelium removal and abrogated in the presence of the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor N<sup>G</sup>-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (100 muM). In addition, G-1 significantly decreased NADPH (100 muM)-stimulated superoxide production by carotid and intracranial (pooled basilar and middle cerebral) arteries but also attenuated the superoxide signal detected in a cell-free xanthine/xanthine oxidase assay. Furthermore, GPR30 immunoreactivity was observed in endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells of carotid arteries from both genders.

Endothelium-dependent relaxation by G protein-coupled receptor 30 agonists in rat carotid arteries. Am J Physiol Heart Circ Physiol 298: H1055-H1061, 2010. First published January 8, 2010; doi:10.1152/ajpheart.00878.2009.-Recent studies have identified that the novel membrane estrogen receptor, G protein-coupled receptor 30 (GPR30), is present in blood vessels. However, the signaling mechanisms associated with GPR30 in the vasculature remain unclear. We examined whether putative agonists of GPR30 exert vasorelaxant and/or antioxidant effects similar to those reported for estrogen. Using wire myography, we assessed the role of the endothelium in relaxation responses to the GPR30 agonists, G-1 and 5408-0877 (1 nM-10 mu M), in U-46619-precontracted common carotid arteries from Sprague-Dawley rats. Furthermore, using lucigenin (5 mu M)-enhanced chemiluminescence, we tested the effect of G-1 (10 mu M) on superoxide levels. Specific immunofluorescence was also used to confirm GPR30 expression in the arterial wall. We found that G-1 and 5408-0877 induced a concentration-dependent relaxation in carotid arteries from both male and female rats. Interestingly, G-1 and 5408-0877 induced relaxation was abolished by endothelium removal and abrogated in the presence of the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor N-G-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (100 mu M). In addition, G-1 significantly decreased NADPH (100 mu M)-stimulated superoxide production by carotid and intracranial (pooled basilar and middle cerebral) arteries but also attenuated the superoxide signal detected in a cell-free xanthine/xanthine oxidase assay. Furthermore, GPR30 immunoreactivity was observed in endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells of carotid arteries from both genders. These findings indicate that GPR30 is expressed throughout the arterial wall and that GPR30 agonists elicit endothelial-derived nitric oxide-dependent relaxation of the carotid artery in male and female rats. Additionally, G-1 appears to directly scavenge superoxide anion",0.80744972811008,2010,2010,1,"3","3",1,"H1055-H1061","H1055-H1061",1,"298","298",1,"American Journal of Physiology - Heart and Circulatory Physiology","American Journal of Physiology - Heart and Circulatory Physiology",1,NA,"10.1152/ajpheart.00878.2009",NA,"25373","816"

The IGF-1<sup>+</sup> cells were absent in ischemia plus antagonist group, while the IGF-1 expressed normally in ischemia plus saline group. The number of BrdU<sup>+</sup> cells in the ischemia plus antagonist was sharply decreased compared with the ischemia plus saline group (P < 0.05) in the SVZ 7 days after ischemia. Conclusion: Ischemia/perfusion up-regulates the expression of IGF-1 in neonatal rats, which may promote the proliferation of neural stem cells. Decrease of the neural stem cells proliferation dramatically after the administration of JB1 suggests that IGF-1 may play a key role on recovery of transient forebrain ischemia damage",0.999883653286795,2012,2012,1,"2","2",1,"145-149","April",0,"43","43",1,"Acta Anatomica Sinica","Acta Anatomica Sinica",1,NA,NA,NA,"24667","10078"

Our results suggest that prosaposin aids survival of PC-12 cells from oxidative stress not only by reducing the phosphorylation levels of JNK and p38, but also by regulating the c-Jun/AP-1 pathway.

The current study was undertaken in order to define the mechanism through which ischemia alters dopaminergic neurotransmission, and to examine the subsequent events early during recirculation. Experiments were performed on 14 male anesthetized Sprague Dawley rats. The ischemic insult consisted of 20 min global cerebral ischemia (4-vessel occlusion) followed by 80 min reperfusion. Cardiac arrest concluded this phase of the experiment, but measurements were continued for 60 min more. Measurements of catechols were made in the striatum using in vivo differential pulse voltammetry (DPV), each 4 min, throughout the experiment and for 60 min post-mortem. DPV data were substantiated with intracerebral dialysis; 20 min dialysate samples were analysed for dopamine (DA) and homovanillic acid (HVA; DA metabolite) using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Repeated in vivo DPV measurements of striatal catechols during ischemia/reperfusion were collected in 11 of 14 experiments. In 6 out of 11 rats, ischemia induced a massive catechols release in the striatum, resulting in a marked increase in extracellular level (350 to 1200% of control), which persisted throughout ischemica. In these rats, a marked rise in extracellular DA was detected in the dialysate sample collected in the contralateral striatum during ischemia, together with a fall in HVA, probably due to ischemic inhibition of the enzymatic oxidation of DA. Catechol was cleared from the extracellular space within minutes of reperfusion, indicating functional catechol uptake. In 5 rats only a relatively small and transient catechol increase was detectable, cleared before the end of ischemia, probably reflecting less severe ischemia. DPV revealed a much increase in the catechol peak immediately after cardiac arrest. Also dialysis data showed a massive increase of DA in the striatal extracellular space. These increases were seen in all rats, including the 5 which had shown little response to ischemia. Intracerebral dialysis data obtained in the current study clearly demonstrated that the rise in DPV peak 2 (catechol) represented a massive DA release, associated with a decrease in HVA. DA release in the striatum can result either from an intensification of the firing of dopaminergic neurones in the substantia nigra, or from a direct effect on striatal synaptosomes. In our massive DA released group (6 rats), the magnitude of the DA release and the fact that intense firing of substantia nigra neurones could not be sustained in ischemic conditions, rather support the hypothesis of a direct effect of ischemia on dopaminergic terminals. Although other 5 rats did not show a massive rise in the catechol peak during ischemia, they did so immediately after death. This suggests that ischemia had not been severe enough. The small size of the increase in DPV peak 2, its transient aspect and the fact that it returned to slightly below normal during ischemia, suggest that it could have resulted from a temporary intensification of the firing of doperminergic neurones in the substantia nigra, subsiding to electrical silence as energy ran out.","Many data suggest that the presence of dopamine (DA) is a prerequisite for the development of neuronal damage in the striatum; neural injury could be initiated by a massive release from dopaminergic nerve terminals during ischemia.

Methods: Adult male C57BL/6J mice were randomized to receive vehicle, CSaRA alone or C3aRA and C5aRA 6 and 12 h after ICH, and every 12 h thereafter. A double injection technique was used to infuse 30 mu L, of autologous whole blood into the right striatum. A final group of mice received a sham procedure consisting only of needle insertion followed by vehicle injections. Brain water content and flow cytometry analysis for leukocyte and microglia infiltration and activation in both hemispheres were measured on day 3 post ICH. Neurological dysfunction was assessed using a Morris water-maze (MWM), a 28-point scale, and a comer test at 6, 12, 24, 48 and 72 h after ICH induction. Results: Neurological deficits were present and comparable in all three cohorts 6 h after ICH.

Methods: Superoxide production was measured by the ethidium method in cultured neurons treated with oxygen-glucose deprivation and in mice treated with forebrain ischemia-reperfusion. The role of NADPH oxidase was examined using genetic disruption of its p47(phox) subunit and with the pharmacological inhibitor apocynin. Results: In neuron cultures, postischemic superoxide production and cell death were completely prevented by removing glucose from the medium, by inactivating NADPH oxidase, or by inhibiting the hexose monophosphate shunt that generates NADPH from glucose.

Epo receptor expression is abundant in the developing mammalian brain, and decreases as term approaches. Epo has been identified as a neurotrophic and neuroprotective agent in a wide variety of experimental paradigms, from neuronal cell culture to in vivo models of brain injury. Several mechanisms by which Epo produces neuroprotection are recognized. Epo (i) decreases glutamate toxicity, (ii) induces the generation of neuronal anti-apoptotic factors, (iii) reduces inflammation, (iv) decreases nitric oxide-mediated injury, and (v) has direct antioxidant effects. Conclusion: Collectively, the evidence suggests that Epo may provide a new approach to the treatment of a variety of CNS disorders in adults and children, especially as a possible therapy for perinatal asphyxia.

Epo (i) decreases glutamate toxicity, (ii) induces the generation of neuronal anti-apoptotic factors, (iii) reduces inflammation, (iv) decreases nitric oxide-mediated injury, and (v) has direct antioxidant effects. Conclusion: Collectively, the evidence suggests that Epo may provide a new approach to the treatment of a variety of CNS disorders in adults and children, especially as a possible therapy for perinatal asphyxia. This review summarizes the current knowledge on the neurotrophic and neuroprotective functions of Epo in the developing and injured brain",0.999849510910459,2002,2002,1,NA,NA,NA,"36-42","36-42",1,"91","91",1,"Acta Paediatrica","Acta PaediatricaActa Paediatr.Acta Paediatr",0.874418604651163,"10.1080/080352502320764184","Doi 10.1080/080352502320764184",0.955555555555555,"14964","3809"

Evidence is presented to indicate that the transient, dense glutamatergic innervation of basal structures of the perinatal brain may induce brain damage via overflow of excitatory amino acids during oxygen lack, causing a long-standing overstimulation of excitatory neurons.

These findings implicate PAF in the pathophysiology of TBI, through actions at PAF receptors.

The authors studied the relationship among propofol neuroprotection, glutamate extracellular concentrations, and glutamate transporter activity in a model of ischemic cortical cell cultures. Methods: Thirteen-day-old primary cortical neuronal-glial cultures were exposed to a 90-min combined oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) in an anaerobic chamber, followed by reoxygenation. Propofol was added only during the OGD period, and its effect was compared to that of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist dizocilpine (MK-801).

Oxygen radicals likely mediate the injury. Normally, endothelial cells are anchored to the underlying matrix at focal adhesion sites. Two proteins of the focal adhesion site, c-Src kinase (Src) and focal adhesion kinase (FAK) appear to be important in focal adhesion assembly (1). In isolated rat lungs, we found that ischemic injury is mediated by oxygen radicals (2). In cultured rat pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (RPMEC), we found that exposure to H2O2 caused initial (5-15 min) tyrosine phosphorylation of Src and FAK as well as association of these proteins, followed by dephosphorylation and dissociation of Src and FAK by 30 min (3). Extracellular-related kinase (ERK) may also be involved in signaling of injury. To determine the intracellular signaling mechanisms underlying oxygen radical induced injury, we hypothesized that Src-specific inhibition with PP2 would alter the response of endothelial cells to H2O2. Methods: RPMEC were cultured to confluence on polyethylene terephthalate inserts. Cells were either untreated, treated with PP2, 2 uM, pretreated with PP2, 2uM, for 30 min, followed by addition of H2O2, 100uM to the medium, or with H2O2, 100 uM, alone. Transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER), an indicator of endothelial barrier integrity, was measured over 2 h (n=3). Additional RPMEC were lysed after exposure to PP2 alone, H2O2 + PP2 pretreatment or H2O2 alone at several time points. Lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-Src or anti-FAK antibody, separated by SDS-PAGE, then immunoblotted with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody or anti-FAK for Src IP to determine tyrosine phosphorylation and association of Src and FAK, respectively.

PP2 prevented the early tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK and Src as well as the early H2O2-induced association of Src with FAK. PP2 alone and PP2+H2O2 prevented ERK phosphorylation. Conclusion: Src inhibition fails to protect the endothelial barrier from injury induced by oxygen radicals. Src inhibition alone induces endothelial permeability.

Lysates were also immunoblotted for phosphorylated ERK. (n=3 each) Results: Src inhibitor PP2 alone, H2O2 alone, and PP2 + H2O2 decreased TEER of RPMEC by 25%, 25% and 60%, respectively (p<0.05). PP2 prevented the early tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK and Src as well as the early H2O2-induced association of Src with FAK. PP2 alone and PP2+H2O2 prevented ERK phosphorylation. Conclusion: Src inhibition fails to protect the endothelial barrier from injury induced by oxygen radicals. Src inhibition alone induces endothelial permeability. Src may promote endothelial barrier integrity by its interaction with FAK as well as signaling via an ERK pathway",0.999921568627451,2002,2002,1,"2002","2002",1,"A-1346","Abstract-1346",0.473076923076923,NA,NA,NA,"Anesthesiology Abstracts of Scientific Papers Annual Meeting","Anesthesiology Abstracts of Scientific Papers Annual Meeting",1,NA,NA,NA,"20662","3668"

A major endogenous protective mechanism in many organs against ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury is ischemic preconditioning (IPC). By moderately uncoupling the mitochondrial respiratory chain and decreasing production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), IPC reduces apoptosis induced by I/R by reducing cytochrome c release from the mitochondria. One element believed to contribute to reduce ROS production is the uncoupling protein UCP2 (and UCP3 in the heart). Although its implication in IPC in the brain has been shown in vitro, no in vivo study of protein has shown its upregulation. Our first goal was to determine in rat hippocampus whether UCP2 protein upregulation was associated with IPC-induced protection and increased ROS production. The second goal was to determine whether the peptide ghrelin, which possesses anti-oxidant and protective properties, alters UCP2 mRNA levels in the same way as IPC during protection. Results. After global forebrain ischemia (15 min) with 72 h reperfusion (I/R group), we found important neuronal lesion in the rat hippocampal CA1 region, which was reduced by a preceding 3-min preconditioning ischemia (IPC+I/R group), whereas the preconditioning stimulus alone (IPC group) had no effect. Compared to control, UCP2 protein labelling increased moderately in the I/R (+39%, NS) and IPC+I/R (+28%, NS) groups, and substantially in the IPC group (+339%, P < 0.05). Treatment with superoxide dismutase (10000 U/kg ip) at the time of a preconditioning ischemia greatly attenuated (-73%, P < 0.001) the increase in UCP2 staining at 72 h, implying a role of oxygen radicals in UCP2 induction. Hippocampal UCP2 mRNA showed a moderate increase in I/R (+33%, P < 0.05) and IPC+I/R (+40%, P < 0.05) groups versus control, and a large increase in the IPC group (+333%, P < 0.001). In ghrelin experiments, the I/R+ghrelin group (3 daily administrations) showed considerable protection of CA1 neurons versus I/R animals, and increased hippocampal UCP2 mRNA (+151%, P < 0.001). Conclusion. We confirm that IPC causes increased expression of UCP2 protein in vivo, at a moment appropriate for protection against I/R in the hippocampus. The two dissimilar protective strategies, IPC and ghrelin administration, were both associated with upregulated UCP2, suggesting that UCP2 may often represent a final common pathway in protection from I/R. © 2009 Liu et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","Background.

Treatment with superoxide dismutase (10000 U/kg ip) at the time of a preconditioning ischemia greatly attenuated (-73%, P < 0.001) the increase in UCP2 staining at 72 h, implying a role of oxygen radicals in UCP2 induction. Hippocampal UCP2 mRNA showed a moderate increase in I/R (+33%, P < 0.05) and IPC+I/R (+40%, P < 0.05) groups versus control, and a large increase in the IPC group (+333%, P < 0.001). In ghrelin experiments, the I/R+ghrelin group (3 daily administrations) showed considerable protection of CA1 neurons versus I/R animals, and increased hippocampal UCP2 mRNA (+151%, P < 0.001). Conclusion. We confirm that IPC causes increased expression of UCP2 protein in vivo, at a moment appropriate for protection against I/R in the hippocampus. The two dissimilar protective strategies, IPC and ghrelin administration, were both associated with upregulated UCP2, suggesting that UCP2 may often represent a final common pathway in protection from I/R. 2009 Liu et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd",0.998104417507184,2009,2009,1,"17","1",0.85,NA,"17",NA,"9 (1) (no pagination)","9",0.714285714285714,"BMC PhysiolBMC physiology","BMC PhysiologyBMC Physiol.BMC Physiol",0.879135135135135,NA,NA,NA,"25208","5176"

Recent evidence indicates that fluoxetine, an anti-depressant drug, is shown to have neuroprotective effects in ischaemic brain injury, but the precise mechanism underlying its protective effects is largely unknown. Here, we show that fluoxetine prevented blood-spinal cord barrier disruption via inhibition of matrix metalloprotease activation after spinal cord injury. After a moderate contusion injury at the T9 level of spinal cord with an infinite horizon impactor in the mouse, fluoxetine (10 mg/kg) was injected intraperitoneally and further administered once a day for indicated time points. Fluoxetine treatment significantly inhibited messenger RNA expression of matrix metalloprotease 2, 9 and 12 after spinal cord injury. By zymography and fluorimetric enzyme activity assay, fluoxetine also significantly reduced matrix metalloprotease 2 and matrix metalloprotease 9 activities after injury. In addition, fluoxetine inhibited nuclear factor kappa B-dependent matrix metalloprotease 9 expression in bEnd.3, a brain endothelial cell line, after oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation. Fluoxetine also attenuated the loss of tight junction molecules such as zona occludens 1 and occludin after injury in vivo as well as in bEnd.3 cultures. By immunofluorescence staining, fluoxetine prevented the breakdown of the tight junction integrity in endothelial cells of blood vessel after injury. Furthermore, fluoxetine inhibited the messenger RNA expression of chemokines such as Gro alpha, MIP1 alpha and 1 beta, and prevented the infiltration of neutrophils and macrophages, and reduced the expression of inflammatory mediators after injury. Finally, fluoxetine attenuated apoptotic cell death and improved locomotor function after injury. Thus, our results indicate that fluoxetine improved functional recovery in part by inhibiting matrix metalloprotease activation and preventing blood-spinal cord barrier disruption after spinal cord injury. Furthermore, our study suggests that fluoxetine may represent a potential therapeutic agent for preserving blood-brain barrier integrity following ischaemic brain injury and spinal cord injury in humans.","After spinal cord injury, the disruption of blood-spinal cord barrier by activation of matrix metalloprotease is a critical event leading to infiltration of blood cells, inflammatory responses and neuronal cell death, contributing to permanent neurological disability.

Bowel clamps applied during anastomosis in order to prevent abdominal contamination with colonic contents, may cause microcirculation and perfusion problems and subsequent ischemia-reperfusion injury. Papaverine, a myorelaxant and vasodilatator, and pentoxiphylline, a hemorrheologic agent are used for microcirculation disorders and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a stimulator of angiogenesis. With this experimental study, we aimed to measure trace element [copper (Cu) and zinc (Zn)] levels in ischemia-reperfusion injury due to clamps after left colonic anastomosis in rats and show the effects of papaverine and pentoxiphylline on VEGF that stimulates angiogenesis in anastomotic healing. Materials and methods : 50 female Wistar albino rats were randomized in 5 groups (n : 10). Laparotomy in group I, left colonic transsection and anastomosis in group 2, and clamp application 1 cm proximal and distal to the anastomosis (for about 20 minutes long) during left colonic transsection and anastomosis in groups 3, 4 and 5 were performed. Additionally, after the operations, pentoxiphylline (Group 4) and papaverin (Group 5) were injected intraperitoneally. On the 10(th) postoperative day, plasma trace element and plasma VEGF levels were measured. Results : In this study, VEGF levels in group 1 were significantly low and this was explained as being exposed to hypoxic damage less than the other groups. In group 3, VEGF levels were significantly higher showing that the hypoxic stimulus continued without any treatment and in Group 4, significantly lower than Group 3 related to the inhibition of pentoxiphylline. Lower VEGF levels in Group 1 were thought to be related to lower VEGF induction due to less hypoxic effect. Zinc, an important trace element of the antioxidant system showed significantly higher levels in Group 4 with pentoxiphylline treatment, and this was thought to be related to the antioxidant characteristics of pentoxiphylline. Conclusions : During surgical procedures, care should be taken not to cause ischemia to the intestinal tissues, and trace elements that are important in ischemia reperfusion injury should be replaced appropriately. Although the antioxidant effect of pentoxiphylline in ischemia reperfusion injury may be benefical in treatment, its inhibition of VEGF is a disadvantage in wound healing. (Acta gastroenterol belg, 2011, 74, 22-27)","Background and study aims : Due to their high morbidity and mortality, anastomotic leakage and disruption are still serious problems in colonic surgery. Bowel clamps applied during anastomosis in order to prevent abdominal contamination with colonic contents, may cause microcirculation and perfusion problems and subsequent ischemia-reperfusion injury. Papaverine, a myorelaxant and vasodilatator, and pentoxiphylline, a hemorrheologic agent are used for microcirculation disorders and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a stimulator of angiogenesis. With this experimental study, we aimed to measure trace element [copper (Cu) and zinc (Zn)] levels in ischemia-reperfusion injury due to clamps after left colonic anastomosis in rats and show the effects of papaverine and pentoxiphylline on VEGF that stimulates angiogenesis in anastomotic healing. Materials and methods : 50 female Wistar albino rats were randomized in 5 groups (n : 10). Laparotomy in group I, left colonic transsection and anastomosis in group 2, and clamp application 1 cm proximal and distal to the anastomosis (for about 20 minutes long) during left colonic transsection and anastomosis in groups 3, 4 and 5 were performed. Additionally, after the operations, pentoxiphylline (Group 4) and papaverin (Group 5) were injected intraperitoneally. On the 10(th) postoperative day, plasma trace element and plasma VEGF levels were measured. Results : In this study, VEGF levels in group 1 were significantly low and this was explained as being exposed to hypoxic damage less than the other groups. In group 3, VEGF levels were significantly higher showing that the hypoxic stimulus continued without any treatment and in Group 4, significantly lower than Group 3 related to the inhibition of pentoxiphylline.

Five different doses of bifemelane (0.2-25.0 mg/kg) as well as saline were administered intraperitoneally in 6 groups of animals (n = 46), and 30 min afterward both common carotid arteries were occluded. The brain was removed 90 min after the occlusion, and the cerebral water content (CWC) in the bifemelane treated groups and the controls was compared. To assess hemodynamic effects of bifemelane, regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was also measured in 24 animals using hydrogen clearance techniques. The CWC in the saline-treated controls (79.9 .+-. 0.4%) was significantly increased compared to the normal values (78.4 .+-. 0.3%). The CWC in the groups receiving 1 mg/kg, 5 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg of bifemelane showed 79.3 .+-. 0.3%, 79.5 .+-. 0.2% and 78.9 .+-. 0.3%, which were significantly lower than the controls (p < 0.005, p < 0.02, p < 0.001). Thus, bifemelane reduced a development of ischemic cerebral edema in a dose-dependent manner. The rCBF in the bifemelane groups and the controls measured before the drug administration was the same ranging within 35.0-37.0 ml/100 g brain/min. The administration of bifemelane produced small rCBF increase. After the carotid artery occlusion, rCBF in all control animals decreased below 6.0 ml/100 g brain/min, the critical level for cellular ion-pump function. The majority of bifemelane-treated animals also showed a similar flow reduction. However, in 33% of animals receiving 10 mg/kg or 25 mg/kg of bifemelane, rCBF was maintained above this critical level. The results of the present study suggest that bifemelane may have suppressive effects on ischemic cerebral edema. Judging from the fact that cerebral edema was most remarkably depressed in 10 mg/kg group associating with some collateral blood flow increase, the circulatory improvement might play some role in the mechanism of edema suppression. However, the role of circulatory improvement is probably small, since 25 mg/kg of bifemelane also produced a collateral blood flow increase but failed to suppress the edema. The anti-edema effects of bifemelane seem to be based on some other mechanisms, such as the inhibition of membrane lipid hyperoxidation, which was found to exist in this agent recently.","Effects of the new chemical agent, bifemelane, on ischemic cerebral edema were studied in 70 mongolian gerbils.

In addition, inclusion of a PAR-1 antagonist prevented the protective effects elicited by TPC. In contrast to the effects of the PAR-1 agonist, PAR-4 agonist preconditioning afforded no such protection. indeed, in a lower-dose model of 6-OHDA (5 mu g), PAR-4 preconditioning significantly increased behavioral deficits. These results indicate that the protective effects of TPC in this model are mediated through PAR-1 activation. Neither the effects of PAR-1 nor TPC on later 6-OHDA-induced behavioral deficits appeared to be mediated through dopamine (DA) content sparing.

Methods: We examined the phenotype of G93A SOD mice lacking the EP2 receptor and performed immunocytochemistry, quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, and Western analyses to determine the mechanism of EP2 toxicity in this model. Results: EP2 receptor is significantly induced in G93A SOD mice in astrocytes and microglia in parallel with increases in expression of proinflammatory enzymes and lipid peroxidation. In human ALS, EP2 receptor immunoreactivity was upregulated in astrocytes in ventral spinal cord. In aging G93A SOD mice, genetic deletion of the prostaglandin E-2 EP2 receptor improved motor strength and extended survival. Deletion of the EP2 receptor in G93A SOD mice resulted in significant reductions in levels of proinflammatory effectors, including cyclooxygenase-1, cyclooxygenase-2, inducible nitric oxide synthase, and components of the NADPH oxidase complex. In alternate models of inflammation, including the lipopolysaccharide model of innate immunity and the APPSwe-PS1 Delta E9 model of amyloidosis, deletion of EP2 also reduced expression of proinflammatory genes.

Therefore, the effect of human plasmin (Pli), human miniplasmin (mPli), and an Fab fragment neutralizing murine alpha2-AP (Fab-4H9) on FII after middle cerebral artery (MCA) ligation was studied in mice and in hamsters. In BALB/c mice, the median FII after 24 hours was 28 muL (range, 20-34) (n = 10) with saline and 23 muL (range, 17-26) (n = 9) with a single bolus of 0.07 mg Pli, given after MCA ligation (P = .010), which reduced alpha2-AP to 44% and fibrinogen from 0.75 to 0.44 g/L.

SE 211475 (4-[2-hydroxyl-3-[[2-(2-methoxy-phenoxy) ethyl]amino]propoxyl]-9H-carbazol-3-ol), a hydroxylated carvedilol analogue, is an even more potent antioxidant in several assay systems. Carvedilol also has neuroprotective capacity with modulatory actions at N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors and Na+ channels. In the present study, we demonstrated that in cultured rat cerebellar neurons, SE 211475 has 28-fold greater antioxidant activity than carvedilol, but is 2- to 6-fold less potent, respectively, at inhibiting neurotoxic activities at Na+ channels and at NMDA receptor channels. To determine a biophysical rationale for these differential activities, small angle x-ray scattering data were obtained from model lipid and brain membrane bilayers containing either carvedilol, SE 211475, or dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers. Electron density profiles revealed that the location of SE 211475 was restricted to the glycerol backbone/hydrocarbon interface and significantly reduced membrane width by 5%, whereas the time-averaged location for carvedilol and flunarizine also extended to the hydrated surface of the bilayer. Comparison of carvedilol with several dihydropyridines showed a correlation between high CIogP values (lipophilicity), Na+ channel inhibitory potency, and bilayer localization. The antioxidant activity of SE 211475 could be explained by restricted intercalation into the glycerol phosphate/hydrocarbon interface, creating an increase in volume associated with the phospholipid acyl chains, which would then become resistant to lipid peroxidation.

(C) 1998 Elsevier Science Inc.","Carvedilol is a vasodilating beta-blocker and antioxidant approved for treatment of mild to moderate hypertension, angina, and congestive heart failure. SE 211475 (4-[2-hydroxyl-3-[[2-(2-methoxy-phenoxy) ethyl]amino]propoxyl]-9H-carbazol-3-ol), a hydroxylated carvedilol analogue, is an even more potent antioxidant in several assay systems. Carvedilol also has neuroprotective capacity with modulatory actions at N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors and Na+ channels. In the present study, we demonstrated that in cultured rat cerebellar neurons, SE 211475 has 28-fold greater antioxidant activity than carvedilol, but is 2- to 6-fold less potent, respectively, at inhibiting neurotoxic activities at Na+ channels and at NMDA receptor channels. To determine a biophysical rationale for these differential activities, small angle x-ray scattering data were obtained from model lipid and brain membrane bilayers containing either carvedilol, SE 211475, or dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers. Electron density profiles revealed that the location of SE 211475 was restricted to the glycerol backbone/hydrocarbon interface and significantly reduced membrane width by 5%, whereas the time-averaged location for carvedilol and flunarizine also extended to the hydrated surface of the bilayer. Comparison of carvedilol with several dihydropyridines showed a correlation between high CIogP values (lipophilicity), Na+ channel inhibitory potency, and bilayer localization. The antioxidant activity of SE 211475 could be explained by restricted intercalation into the glycerol phosphate/hydrocarbon interface, creating an increase in volume associated with the phospholipid acyl chains, which would then become resistant to lipid peroxidation. Differential channel modulation may also be explained by these membrane structural results, which indicate that carvedilol and the less spatially restricted dihydropyridine molecules are more likely to inhibit transmembrane receptor channels.

Clinical concentrations of sevoflurane affect the Delta Psi(m) in neural mitochondria, but the mechanisms remain elusive. The aim of the present study was to compare the effect of isoflurane and sevoflurane on Delta Psi(m) in rat pre-synaptic terminals (synaptosomes), and to investigate whether these agents affect Delta Psi(m) by inhibiting the respiratory chain. Methods: Synaptosomes were loaded with the fluorescent probes JC-1 (Delta Psi(m)) and Fura-2 ([Ca2+](i)) and exposed to isoflurane or sevoflurane. The effect of the anaesthetics on the electron transport chain was investigated by blocking complex I and complex V.

Therefore, it was aimed to study whether dipyridamole (CAS 58-322), an adenosine uptake inhibitor, or adenosine (CAS 58-61-7) could affect the rat brain gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA, CAS 56-12-2) level after Induction of cerebral ischemia, and to test their effect on the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity of the ischemic rat brain. Ischemia was induced by bilateral clamping of the common carotid arteries for 60 min followed by reperfusion for other 60 min. Dipyridamole was administered alone and in combination with adenosine and the effect of the drugs on the brain GABA level as well as on LDH activity was determined.

The present study examined whether elevated production of 20-HETE in the cerebral vasculature could contribute to the larger infarct size previously reported after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in hypertensive strains of rat [spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) and spontaneously hypertensive stroke-prone rat (SHRSP)]. The synthesis of 20-HETE in the cerebral vasculature of SHRSP measured by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry was about twice that seen in Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats.

Infarct volume after transient MCAO was greater in SHRSP (36 +/- 4% of hemisphere volume) than in SHR (19 +/- 5%) or WKY rats (5 +/- 2%). This was associated with a significantly greater reduction in regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in SHR and SHRSP than in WKY rats during the ischemic period (78% vs. 62%). In WKY rats, rCBF returned to 75% of control following reperfusion. In contrast, SHR and SHRSP exhibited a large (166 +/- 18% of baseline) and sustained (1 h) postischemic hyperperfusion.

The effect of barbiturates on lipid peroxidation measured as malondialdehyde and 4-hydroxynon-2-enal was also investigated Hypoxia studies were then performed on human NT2-N neurons, The cells were exposed to 10 h of hypoxia or combined oxygen and glucose deprivation for 3 or 5 h in the presence of thiopental (50-600 mu M), methohexital (50-400 mu M), phenobarbital (10-400 mu M), or pentobarbital (10-400 mu M), and cell death was evaluated after 24 h by lactate dehydrogenase release.

Methods: Hydroxyl radicals were generated by ascorbic acid and iron and were measured by conversion of salicylate to 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid. The effect of barbiturates on lipid peroxidation measured as malondialdehyde and 4-hydroxynon-2-enal was also investigated Hypoxia studies were then performed on human NT2-N neurons, The cells were exposed to 10 h of hypoxia or combined oxygen and glucose deprivation for 3 or 5 h in the presence of thiopental (50-600 mu M), methohexital (50-400 mu M), phenobarbital (10-400 mu M), or pentobarbital (10-400 mu M), and cell death was evaluated after 24 h by lactate dehydrogenase release. Results: Pentobarbital, phenobarbital, methohexital, and thiopental dose-dependently inhibited formation of 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid and iron-stimulated lipid peroxidation, There were significant but moderate differences in antioxidant action between the barbiturates. While phenobarbital (10-400 mu M) and pentobarbital (10-50 mu M) increased lactate dehydrogenase release after combined oxygen and glucose deprivation, thiopental and methohexital protected the neurons at all tested concentrations. At a higher concentration (400 mu M), pentobarbital also significantly protected the neurons, At both 50 and 400 mu M, thiopental and methohexital protected the NT2-N neurons significantly better than phenobarbital and pentobarbital. Conclusions: Barbiturates differ markedly in their neuroprotective effects against combined oxygen and glucose deprivation in human NT2-N neurons.

It was suggested that oxidant stress plays an important role in neuronal injury after SAH. Therefore, we assessed the effect of curcumin on reducing cerebral vasospasm and neurologic injury in a SAH model in rat. Methods: A double-hemorrhage model was used to induce SAH in rats. Groups of animals were treated with intraperitoneal injection of 20 mg/kg curcumin (curcumin group, n = 24) or dimethyl sulfoxide (vehicle group, n = 33), normal saline (SAH group, n = 34) or normal saline (sham group, n = 22), 3 h after SAH induction and daily for 6 days.

Glutamate transporter-1, wall thickness and the perimeter of the basilar artery, neurologic scores, neuronal degeneration, malondialdehyde, superoxide dismutase, and catalase activities were assessed. Results: Changes of glutamate levels were lower in the curcumin group versus the SAH and vehicle groups, especially on day 1 (56 folds attenuation vs. vehicle). Correspondingly, glutamate transporter-1 was preserved after SAH in curcumin-treated rats. In the hippocampus and the cortex, malondialdehyde was attenuated (30% and 50%, respectively).

In C57BL/6 mice, hair cell loss begins around 1-2 months of age and progresses rapidly along a base-to-apex gradient, whereas CBA mice show relatively little hair cell loss until late in life. This anatomical difference is reflected in dehydrogenase histochemistry, an indirect measure of aerobic energy metabolism. A small, but significant, decrease in hair cell dehydrogenase staining occurred in CBA mice between 1.5 and 18 months of age. Significantly, dehydrogenase levels in 1.5-month C57 mice were substantially lower than in CBA mice of any age. Thus, deficits in aerobic energy metabolism presage degeneration of the hair cells. The superoxide radical, O-2(.-), a normal byproduct of cellular metabolism, is potentially toxic and can cause cellular damage if it is not inactivated by superoxide dismutases. Cytosolic copper/zinc superoxide dismutase (SOD1) is highly expressed in the cochlea. Knockout mutant mice with a single (HET) or double deletion (KO) of the Sod1 gene coding for SOD1 showed greater age-related losses than wild-type (WT) mice.

Methods: After approval by the local animal care committee, 24 pigs (age 12-16 weeks) were investigated in a randomized design. Following surgical preparation for determination of general hemodynamics, intracranial pressure (ICP) and brain-tissue oxygenation (ptiO2) and performing cerebral microdialysis (CMD), the animals were divided in two groups to receive anesthesia with either xenon 75% in oxygen or TIVA combined with air 75% in oxygen ventilation 15 min prior to cardiac arrest. After cardiac arrest of 4min, CPR was performed for 1min and the induced ventricular fibrillation was terminated by electrical defibrillation. After return of spontaneous circulation, the animals underwent an investigation time of 240min. Every 30min hemodynamic parameters, ICP, EEG, ptiO2 and CMD parameters like interstitial glycerol as a damage marker, lacatate/ pyruvate ratio as a metabolic marker and glutamate as an excitatory amino acid were investigated. Results: After about 60s of cardiac arrest, ptiO2 dropped to a critical level, paralleled by a decrease in EEG activity. Glycerol increased significantly (>200muMol/ l; p<0,05), with a peak 90 min after cardiac arrest in both groups. Also the lactae/ pyruvate increased to a pathologic peak (>20) after 90 min following cardiac arrest as a sign of disturbed metabolism in both groups, going back to normal values during the following hours. As a major finding of this study, glycerol levels during reperfusion were lower and normalized significantly faster in the xenon group as compared to the TIVA group. Conclusion: Cardiac arrest and resuscitation in this animal model produced a transient cerebral ischemic attack, demonstrated as pathologic CMD damage and metabolic markers. The data indicate that the primary ischaemic lesion in this model was equal in both groups and seems to be independent of the anaesthetic drug. However, during the reperfusion the recovery seems to be faster in the xenon group as compared to the TIVA group. Further investigations are necessary to confirm a neuroprotective effect of xenon, potentially related to its neuroprotective effect via N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonism.

With the growing awareness of their social and economic importance, increasing attention is being given to neuroprotective strategies. In vivo and in vitro data suggesting a role for xenon in neuroprotection, the current study was designed to determine whether xenon, an N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonist, would attenuate cardiac arrest induced brain injury in pigs. Methods: After approval by the local animal care committee, 24 pigs (age 12-16 weeks) were investigated in a randomized design.

In SHRs or SD rats, this effect was blocked by OTA or ICI-182780 administration. The OTR was mainly localized in microvessels expressing the CD31 marker and colocalized with endothelial nitric oxide synthase. In SHRs, the genistein-stimulated OTR increases were associated with improved fractional shortening, decreased blood pressure (12 mmHg), decreased heart weight-to-body weight ratio, decreased fibrosis, and lowered brain natriuretic peptide in the LV. The prominent finding of the study is the detrimental effect of OTA treatment on the LV of SHRs. OTA treatment of OVX SHRs resulted in a dramatic worsening of ejection fractions and an augmented fibrosis.

The PUFA profile in choline- and ethanolamine-phosphoglycerides was similar in tg and nontransgenic (ntg) animals of either fetal or adult brain. Serine-phosphoglycerides, however, showed a marked decrease from 20.07+/-0.53 to 14.92+/-0.87 wt% and 14.52 +/- 1.15 wt% in docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; 22:6 n3), in the tg 51 and tg 69 fetal brains, respectively, but not in the comparable adult tissues. The alpha-tocopherol levels were significantly higher in the fetal compared to the adult brain. There were no differences in the anti-oxidant levels between the ntg and tg fetal brains, but there were differences in the adult animals; the tg mice were higher by at least two-fold than the control animals. The basal TBARS in the tg 51 fetal brain was 35% lower than that of ntg mouse and in the presence of Fe2+, brain slices from the former released less TBARS (57% reduction) into the medium than the latter. These results suggest that higher dosages of Cu/Zn-SOD gene are compatible with increased alpha-tocopherol levels, reduced basal TEARS levels and a DHA deficiency in the fetal, but not the adult, tg brain.

Experimental groups were pretreated with vehicle, NS-398 (a selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor, 1 mg/kg), Diaz (3 mg/kg), or 5-HD (20 mg/kg) + Diaz. Potential direct effects of Diaz and 5-HD on hypercapnic vasodilation were also tested in the absence of I/R (n=5). To confirm the direct effect of Diaz on mitochondria, mitochondrial membrane potential in cultured piglet cerebrovascular endothelial cells was monitored using Mito Tracker Red. Hypercapnia resulted in dose-dependent pial arteriolar vasodilation, which was attenuated by similar to 70% after I/R in vehicle- and NS-398-treated animals. Diaz and 5-HD did not affect the CO2 response. Diaz significantly preserved the postischemic vasodilation response to hypercapnia, but not to Ilo. Diaz depolarized mitochondria in cultured piglet cerebrovascular endothelial cells, and 5-HD completely abolished the protective effect of Diaz, both findings indicate a role for mitoK(ATP) channels. In summary, preservation of arteriolar dilator responsiveness by Diaz may contribute to neuroprotection",0.999889258028793,2005,2005,1,"1","1",1,"H368-H373","H368-H373",1,"289","289",1,"American Journal of Physiology-Heart and Circulatory Physiology","American Journal of Physiology-Heart and Circulatory Physiology",1,"10.1152/ajpheart.00887.2004","10.1152/ajpheart.00887.2004",1,"14066","1911"

Quinacrine treated rats showed significantly reduced infarct areas in the caudoputamen compared to saline treated rats (P < 0.05, Student's t-test). When both cortical and striatal damage were summed, quinacrine treated animals also exhibited a significantly lower degree of damage compared to saline controls (P < 0.05). This study supports the notion that PLA, plays an important role in the development of neuronal injury following transient focal ischemia.

Methods: Male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Experiment 1 was used to evaluate time course expressions of 12/15-LOX, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), phosphorylated-p38MAPK (phospho-p38MAPK) and cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) after cerebral ischemia, seven time points were included.

Compared with MCAO group, atorvastatin dramatically reduced brain water content and infarct sizes, and the over-expressions of 12/15-LOX, p38MAPK, phospho-p38MAPK and cPLA2 were significantly decreased in high dose group (20 mg/kg, P<0.05). Meanwhile, extra-vascular IgG was not only reduced, but BBB permeability was also ameliorated. Conclusions: Atorvastatin protected brain from damage caused by MCAO at the early stage; this effect may be through down-regulation of 12/15-LOX, p38MAPK and cPLA2 expressions, and ameliorating BBB permeability.

Rat traumatic brain injury (TBI) was performed using a weight drop model. Apocynin (100 mg/kg) was injected into the intraperitoneal space 15 min before TBI. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the hippocampal CA3 pyramidal neurons were detected by dihydroethidium (dHEt) at 3 h after TBI. Oxidative injury was detected by 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (4HNE) at 6 h after TBI. Blood-brain barrier disruption was detected by IgG extravasation and neuronal death was evaluated with Fluoro Jade-B staining 24h after TBI. Microglia activation was detected by CD11b immunohistochemistry in the hippocampus at 1 week after TBI. ROS production was inhibited by apocynin administration in the hippocampal CA3 pyramidal neurons. This pre-treatment with apocynin decreased the blood-brain barrier disruption, the number of degenerating neurons in the hippocampal CA3 region and microglial activation after TBI. The present study indicates that apocynin pre-treatment prevents TBI-induced ROS production, thus decreasing BBB disruption, neuronal death and microglial activation.

Methods: Transient retinal ischemia was induced in Long-Evans rats for 60 minutes using temporal ligation of the optic nerve. Leukocyte-endothelial interactions in the post-ischemic retina were evaluated in vivo with a scanning laser ophthalmoscope. Statin was administered 5 minutes before the induction of retinal ischemia.

Results: The preadministration of statin attenuated the rolling and accumulation of leukocytes, decreased P-selectin and ICAM-1 expression, and reduced the number of apoptotic cells in the retina.

Spinal cord ischemia was induced by occlusion of the abdominal aorta between the left renal artery and aortic bifurcation for 45 minutes, followed by reperfusion. Neurological status was assessed before spinal ischemia and at 48 hours postoperatively. Spinal cords were harvested for histopathologic examination with hematoxylin-eosin staining and biochemical analysis for tissue malondialdehyde, superoxide dismutase, and glutathione peroxidase levels. Results: Decreased spinal cord tissue malondialdehyde levels (p = .01) and increased tissue superoxide dismutase (p = .01) and glutathione peroxidase (p = .09) levels were observed in the RSV-treated group, as compared with the ischemia group. Histopathologic analyses demonstrated typical changes of ischemic necrosis in the ischemia group; however, RSV attenuated tissue necrosis. Total injury score in the RSV-treated group was significantly decreased, as compared with the ischemia group (p < .05).

The brain temperature in rats housed in a cold room reduced temporarily to approximately 30 degreesC and then gradually recovered to 35 degreesC by the end of the observation. Brain water content in the basal ganglia was significantly reduced in rats treated with hypothermia compared to the normothermic rats (84.3 +/-0.2 vs. 82.4 +/-0.1%: P<0.01). The decrease of brain water content was accompanied with a significant reduction in BBB permeability to Evan's blue dye and in accumulation of PMN leukocytes. This study indicates that hypothermic treatment significantly reduces thrombin-induced brain edema formation in the rat. Inhibition of thrombin-induced BBB breakdown and inflammatory response by hypothermia appear to contribute to brain protection in this model. Hypothermic treatment may provide an approach to potentially reduce ongoing edema after ICH. <(c)> 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

In diseases characterized by oxidative stress, the extracellular glutamate concentration increases and contributes to neuronal death. The authors wanted to determine whether propofol defends brain cells against oxidant-induced changes in their transport of glutamate. Methods: Primary cultures of rat cerebral astrocytes were exposed to tert-butyl hydroperoxide (1 mM) to serve as an in vitro model of oxidative stress. Astrocytes were incubated with propofol for 2 h and tert-butyl hydroperoxide was added for the final hour. Alternatively, astrocytes were incubated with tert-butyl hydroperoxide for 30 min and then with propofol for another 30 mini, Control cells received drug vehicle rather than propofol. The rate of uptake of glutamate, the efflux of the nonmetabolizable analog D-aspartate, and the intracellular concentration of the endogenous antioxidant glutathione were measured. Results: Tert-butyl hydroperoxide decreased the glutathione concentration and inhibited glutamate uptake but had a negligible effect on D-aspartate efflux. At clinically relevant concentrations. propofol did not affect the glutathione concentration bur did prevent the effect of tert-butyl hydroperoxide on glutamate transport.

In the in vivo cerebral infarct model (60 min middle cerebral artery occlusion followed by 24 h reperfusion), KR-33028 reduced infarct size in a dose-dependent manner.

Focal brain ischemia was induced by the permanent occlusion of middle cerebral artery (pMCAO) for 24 h with a silicone rubber cylinder inserted through the right internal carotid artery. We found that wogonin, intraperitoneally administered at a dosage of 20 mg/kg at 30 min before and 4 h after the surgery, reduced the pMCAO-induced infarct areas in the cerebral cortex as well as in the striatum.

Since SEEMS have antioxidant activity, ER-independent mechanisms were studied using the classical phenolic antioxidants, BHT and Trolox, and the Nrf2-dependent cytoprotective electrophile, sulforaphane. However, neuroprotection by these agents was not sensitive to GPR30 antagonism. Collectively, these data indicate that the activity of neuroprotective BT-SERMs is GPR30-dependent and ER-independent and not mediated by antioxidant effects. Comparison of novel BT-SERM derivatives and analogues identified a neuroprotective pharmacophore of potential use in design of novel neuroprotective agents with a spectrum of ER activity",0.999876160990712,2011,2011,1,"5","5",1,"256-268","256-268",1,"2","2",1,"ACS Chem NeurosciACS chemical neuroscience","ACS Chemical NeuroscienceACS Chem.

Since then, vitamin E has revealed many important molecular properties such as the scavenging of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species or the modulation of signal transduction and gene expression in antioxidant and nonantioxidant manners. A congenital disease, ataxia with vitamin E deficiency, which is characterized by impaired enrichment of a-tocopherol (aT) in plasma due to mutations in the a-tocopherol transfer protein gene, has been discovered. An effect of vitamin E on angiogenesis and vasculogenesis has been observed in several studies, and recently, it has been demonstrated in the placenta of pregnant ewes, possibly involving the stimulation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression. We recently observed that the phosphorylated form of aT, a-tocopheryl phosphate (aTP), increases the expression of VEGF. We propose that the stimulatory effect of aT on angiogenesis and vasculogenesis is potentiated by phosphorylation to aTP, which may act as a cofactor or active lipid mediator increasing VEGF expression. Increased VEGF expression and consequent enhanced angiogenesis and vasculogenesis induced by aTP may explain not only the essential roles of vitamin E on reproduction, but also its beneficial effects against pre-eclampsia, ischemia/reperfusion injury, and during wound healing. It may also serve as a survival factor for brain and muscle cells. The finding that aTP may regulate vasculogenesis may indicate potential, important pathophysiological implications.","Vitamin E was originally discovered as a dietary factor essential for reproduction in rats.

An effect of vitamin E on angiogenesis and vasculogenesis has been observed in several studies, and recently, it has been demonstrated in the placenta of pregnant ewes, possibly involving the stimulation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression. We recently observed that the phosphorylated form of aT, a-tocopheryl phosphate (aTP), increases the expression of VEGF. We propose that the stimulatory effect of aT on angiogenesis and vasculogenesis is potentiated by phosphorylation to aTP, which may act as a cofactor or active lipid mediator increasing VEGF expression. Increased VEGF expression and consequent enhanced angiogenesis and vasculogenesis induced by aTP may explain not only the essential roles of vitamin E on reproduction, but also its beneficial effects against pre-eclampsia, ischemia/reperfusion injury, and during wound healing. It may also serve as a survival factor for brain and muscle cells. The finding that aTP may regulate vasculogenesis may indicate potential, important pathophysiological implications",0.999874134675897,2012,2012,1,"1","1",1,"24-33","24-33",1,"38","38",1,"BiofactorsBioFactors (Oxford, England)","BiofactorsBiofactorsBiofactors",0.890245614035088,"10.1002/biof.198",NA,NA,"18545","10460"

MATERIALS AND METHODS Eight-week-old male Sprague Dawley rats were allocated to one of four groups; an AUR group that had urinary retention induced, with subsequent catheterization; two edaravone groups, given edaravone at 1 or 10 mg/kg body weight for 60 min and then the same urinary retention and subsequent catheterization; and a sham-operated control group given edaravone 10 mg/kg. Urinary retention was induced by the clamping the rat penile urethra with a small clip, making a cystostomy, and then infusing 3 mL (0.6 mL/min) of saline with an infusion pump. The obstruction was sustained for 30 min and then the bladder was allowed to drain with a catheter in place for 60 min as the studies continued. After killing the rats the function of the bladder was assessed, with carbachol and 100 mm KCl, and the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA, a marker of lipid peroxidation), 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG; a marker of oxidative DNA damage), heat-shock protein 70 (HSP 70) and its mRNA were measured. RESULTS AUR increased the intravesical pressure and decreased blood flow, and subsequent catheterization decreased the intravesical pressure and increased blood flow. Edaravone induced a decrease in blood flow in the bladder during the urinary retention and subsequent catheterization compared to the blood flow in the AUR group. Edaravone resulted in protection of the contractile responses to both carbachol and KCl in a dose-dependent manner. The MDA concentration, 8-OHdG content and expressions of HSP-70 and its mRNA in the AUR group were significantly larger than those of the control group. Edaravone markedly suppressed the accumulations of MDA and 8-OHdG in the bladder, and reduced the expressions of HSP 70 and its mRNA. CONCLUSION These results indicate that edaravone reduces the oxidative stress and prevents the bladder dysfunction caused by AUR and subsequent catheterization.","OBJECTIVE To investigate the effect of a free-radical scavenger, edaravone, on the changes occurring with acute urinary retention (AUR) and subsequent catheterization in the rat bladder.
